# Noise-Aware Video Saliency Prediction (BMVC 2021)

This is the repository for the code and the ForGED dataset accompanying our paper on the noise-aware training (NAT) paradigm for video saliency prediction published at BMVC 2021 ([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08038.pdf)).

We plan to release a sample implementation of the proposed NAT loss function as well as the ForGED saliency dataset soon.
